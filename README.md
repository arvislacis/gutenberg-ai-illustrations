# Moby-Dick with AI Illustrations

An interactive reading experience of Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* that generates Renaissance-style illustrations as you read.

## How it works

- Open `moby-dick.html` in your browser
- Enter your [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) when prompted
- Read the book — after you stop scrolling for ~1 second, an illustration matching the visible text fades in on the right
- Select specific text to generate an illustration for that passage
- Scroll again and the image fades out

The illustrations are generated using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model in a da Vinci sketchbook style — black ink engravings that blend with the page.
